Stress Test Performance Report (ST-001)

After introducing 23 additional AI defense agents into the confined test area,
the system reached its performance breakpoint. The overwhelming number of simultaneous 
FixedUpdate physics calculations caused the Frame Rate (FPS) to consistently drop below the critical
threshold of 30 frames per second. This indicates that the current implementation's stability limit 
is approximately 121-125 concurrent AI entities in dense conflict.
